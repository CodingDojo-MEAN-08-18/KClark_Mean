Restful Tasks CRUD

Objectives:
* Make a full CRUD app with Angular, Express, Node, and MongoDB
* Incorporate forms to allow a user to post data

Using your Task API assignment from the Mongo course, use Angular to complete the front-end portion of the API. We should be able to create a new task, view all tasks, update tasks, and delete tasks. Upon loading the page, have all the tasks displayed. When a new task is created, it should be appended to the list of tasks and the form should be cleared out. When a task is edited, have the edited task replace the task in the list. None of these actions should cause a refresh of the page. 

BONUS: Implement backend validations.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
