For this exercise, create a javascript file called 'mathlib.js'.  We're not going to make a node server for this exercise, but we'll still make a file called app.js.  Within app.js, we're going to require our mathlib module and use its functionality to do some basic computations.

In this javascript module, you're going to return a javascript object that allows the developer to do the following tricks.

1. add two numbers (e.g. math.add(2,3) should return 5)
2. multiply two numbers (e.g. math.multiply(3,5) should return 15)
3. square a number (e.g. math.square(5) should return 25)
4. return a random number between the two numbers (e.g. math.random(1,35) should return a random number between 1 and 35)
