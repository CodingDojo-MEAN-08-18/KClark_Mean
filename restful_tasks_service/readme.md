Objectives:
* Include a service in your existing Angular app

Building off your Restful Task API assignment, add a service. Add functions to your service that make AJAX requests to all the get routes you made for the Restful Task API. This includes retrieving all tasks and retrieving a task by ID. Depending on how you wrote your API, it may also include deleting a task by ID. For now, have the service print the data it receives to the console. To complete this assignment, the service will need to be created, registered, and injected into the root component. Also, you'll need HttpClient in order to communicate with your server.
